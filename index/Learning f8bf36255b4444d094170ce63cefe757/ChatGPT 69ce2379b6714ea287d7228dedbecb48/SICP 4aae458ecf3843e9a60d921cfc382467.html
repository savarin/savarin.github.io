A &quot;tail call&quot; is a function call that occurs as the last action in a function. If a recursive call is a tail call, the current function&#x27;s stack frame can be reused for the recursive call, rather than pushing a new frame onto the call stack. This optimization effectively turns the recursion into an iteration under the hood, eliminating the risk of stack overflow and reducing memory usage.</li></ul><ul id="084de9a4-5e72-4a8e-ae3c-3fb78683ca8b" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">TCO is especially important for functional languages that favor recursion over iteration, as it allows for efficient execution of recursive functions that could otherwise consume large amounts of stack space.
